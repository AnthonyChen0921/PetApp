Creative portion: your pet will get hungry and upset!

When you open the app, the pet will get hungry and upset every single second.
You will need to feed it and play with it continuously to make it happy and healthy.
Time() function is created at the beginning of the app.

This function changed the way we use this app. Before the timer, the app really has limited function.
When the pet's happiness level goes to full, the game is over.
Now, the game will be continuously running and fun to play as long as you start it off!
